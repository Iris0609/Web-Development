	<p>This is paragraph tag:Lorem Ipsum is <strong>Here used strong tag, which is the same style as b. However b tag is deprecate in HTML5</strong><b>simply dummy text (here is bold text by use b tag)</b> of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>

	<p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining <em>essentially unchanged here we used em tag, which means emphasize. It is the same as i tag</em>. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <i>Aldus PageMaker(here is i tag)</i> including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
